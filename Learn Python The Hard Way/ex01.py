##      Exercise #1 : A Good First Program                                                   ##

## In this file you will complete the program requested of you in the exercise. As this is   ##
## solely for the purposes of memorization of integral syntax, please don't just copy and    ##
## paste the content into this file; rather, type it out into this editor.  Your program     ##
## should output identically to the sample output listed below.                             ##
##                                                                                           ##
## ====Sample Output====                                                                     ##
## Hello World!                                                                              ##
## Hello Again                                                                               ##
## I like typing this.                                                                       ##
## This is fun.                                                                              ##
## Yay! Printing.                                                                            ##
## I'd much rather you 'not'.                                                                ##
## I 'said' do not touch this.                                                               ##
##                                                                                           ##
## ====Note====                                                                              ##
## This guide tells you to use Notepad, but we will be using Visual Studio.  While it does   ##
## build proper programming habits and a deeper knowledge of Python, it is my opinion        ##
## that those benefits come with time.  A True understanding of programming is that which    ##
## you must have a want to pursue; that truly is all that is required to become a proper     ##
## programmer.  As an addendum, VS will allow us to view runtime memory, pause programs,     ##
## and explore Python errors in more detail, which I feel is a benefit for the student.      ##
##                                                                                           ##
## This book uses Python 2.x, or version 2 of Python.  There will be some errors thrown by   ##
## Visual Studio in the process of using the book's code.  In the future, this note will be  ##
## here to explain inconsistencies between Python 2.x and Python 3.x, and a method for       ##
## translating the book's code into Python 3.x.                                              ##
##                                                                                           ##
## In this exercise, we use the "print" keyword.  In Python 3.x, the print statement must    ##
## have its content enclosed by parenthesis. EG print "hey" should be print ("Hey")          ##
