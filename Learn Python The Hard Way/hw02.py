## In this file you will build a program to fulfil the requested task. You should only use   ##
## the input detailed in the summary, and your output must follow that of the sample output. ##
## Always make sure to comment your code with meaningful comments; this may seem tedious,    ##
## but will be worth it in the end.                                                          ##
##                                                                                           ##
## ====Task====                                                                              ##
## Your boss needs you to change his market front's script in order to reflect changes in    ##
## production.  He no longer wants to sell shepherd's pies, as they do not maintain the      ##
## image he wants to portray.  Also, he will no longer be creating MEGA SIZED pies. Lastly,  ##
## he wants the list of pies to be in alphabetical order.                                    ##
##                                                                                           ##
## However, he asks that you do not delete to code, should he ever wish to add the items     ##
## back into the menu.  Comment out the unnecessary sections of code, and add commentary to  ##
## the existing or new code so that your boss will be able to understand what is going on.   ##
##                                                                                           ##
## ====Sample Output====                                                                     ##
